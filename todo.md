As a next step, I'd like you to work on the short backend assignment where you've to create APIs for a blog website.
Basic useful features:

<!-- _User Login and signup _ -->
<!-- Admin Login -->

<!-- (GET) GET All blog posts (only the titles and author) -->

<!-- (GET) GET details of the single blog post (title + author + content) -->

<!-- (POST) Create a new blog post -->

<!-- (PUT) Update an existing blog post -->

<!-- (DELETE) Delete an existing blog post -->

<!-- (GET) Get the filtered list of posts (filter by title) -->

Note: Admin should be able to delete any blog post, whereas normal users can delete only the blog posts created by them.

Technical Guidelines

Should be done using Node.js.
You can use any Node.js framework of your choice.
Typescript is preferred but not a must.
Zero lint warning and errors.
Use of an ORM is preferred but not a must.
You can use any relational database to store the data.
Submission Guidelines

There should be a README.md file describing how to set up and run code.
Please also share all the endpoints along with their input parameters.
You can use Swagger API Documentation to specify API endpoints.
Please also share the migration script which is used to create DB tables.
Please upload your assignment to GitHub or BitBucket, and share a link with us. Please make sure that the repo is public.
It would be helpful if you share a running instance to test your APIs.
